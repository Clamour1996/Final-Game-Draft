# Final-Game-Draft
A text-based dungeon-crawler game, made for CMSC140, and by Clarence Murzyn

This is PYTHON'S LAIR, a text-based, turn-based fantasy RPG written in Python.
In this game, you must pay careful attention to the world around you to fight enemies,
make friends, evade traps, and descend to the final floor of the mythical "Com-Pyu Tar,"
where The Python awaits foolish adventurers like yourself.

To play, you will regularly be prompted with choices, indicated by [B]rackets.
When prompted, simply type the bracketed letter into the terminal to make
the corresponding choice and hit ENTER to confirm your choice. If no 
bracketed choice is present, please enter whatever value you wish. If you are
unable to type, please be patient and wait until you can.

If your health (HP) hits zero as a result of your choices, it's
GAME OVER

The only way to consistently avoid danger is to pay attention, and remember your failures.
Stay strong, and fight, Warrior!
